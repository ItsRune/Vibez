## Implementation
First things first, you'll need to [download it here.](https://vibez.dev/) Once you've done that, you'll need to open the file and publish to your group as a new game. Afterwards you're ready to customize it to your liking.

## Customization
### Important
To use the rank center, you need to ensure you publish the game and that you have `Allow Third Party Teleports` enabled.
