## Implementation
First things first, you'll need to [download it here.](https://www.google.com/) Once you've done that, you'll need to open the file and publish to your group as a new game. Afterwards you're ready to customize it to your liking.

## Usage
### Important
To use the rank center, you need to ensure you publish the game and that you have `Allow Third Party Teleports` enabled.

### Configuration
Within `ServerScriptService` you'll find a ModuleScript called `Configuration`. This is where all the settings for the rank center are stored. You can change the settings to your liking, but make sure you don't change the names of the settings or else the rank center will revert to it's default settings.
